public class ReverseStringUsingTwoPointersMethod {

        //Strings in Java are immutable (you canâ€™t change them once created).
        //
        //If you try to reverse using concatenation (+),
        // a new String object is created on every iteration â†’ very slow for large strings.
        //
        //By converting the String into a char[] (mutable array),
        // we can modify characters in place without creating new objects.



        //This technique uses two pointers:
        //
        //left starts at the beginning, right starts at the end.
        //
        //Swap characters until they meet in the middle.
        //
        //Each iteration swaps two characters at once.
        //
        //The loop runs only n/2 times (where n = string length).
        //
        //ðŸ‘‰ So time complexity = O(n).

        //No extra memory allocation
        //
        //Apart from the char[] (which is required anyway), we donâ€™t create additional Strings or builders.
        //
        //We only use a constant amount of extra space (temp, left, right).
        //
        //ðŸ‘‰ So space complexity = O(1).

        while(left < right)
        {
          char temp = arr[left];
          arr[left] = arr[right];
          arr[right] = temp;
          left++;
          right--;
